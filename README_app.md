## DealingWithDiscordance

## App Overview

### This current version runs in R

Save the following files into a folder with your discordance data -

1. Shiny_app_discordance.R - this is the app itself
2. UPb_Constants_Functions_Libraries.R
3. UPb_Plotting_Exporting_app_source.R
4. U_Pb_Reduction_2023_rebuild.R
5. fte_them_plotting.R

Next, you need to format your data to be exactly like the "Example_data.csv"

Then open the Shiny_app_discordance file in Rstudio and select all of the code and click "Run app" in the top left corner. 

Then you select your data in the "Browse files" options and then your node spacing and the output plot you want. It may take some time to run.
